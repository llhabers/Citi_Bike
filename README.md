## Situation<br>
I reviewed the New York Citi Bike Program, the largest bike sharing program in the United States to find some insightful information from their data. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. With Citi Bike's robust data, I decieded to build a set of data reports to provide show my findings.<br>

## Task<br>
I was task to aggregate data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. I created 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). I thought about the following questions.<br>

    1. Which day had the highest amounts of trip durations?<br>
    2. What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?<br>
    3. What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?<br>
    4. What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?<br>
    5. Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? (Most popular)<br>
